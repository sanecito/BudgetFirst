## Overview
This is a doc to harden the UI of the BudgetFirst project while the architecture and frameworks are hardened and chosen. To engage with other aspects of the BudgetFirst project, please check [/r/budgetfirst](https://www.reddit.com/r/budgetfirst/) for community forums, the [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/budget-first) to request to join the contributor discussions on [Slack](https://budgetfirst.slack.com) and project management on [Taiga](https://tree.taiga.io/project/urbanhusky-budget-first/), or the eventual code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/BudgetFirst/BudgetFirst)!


## Wireframes Documentation Hardening Process

The following is a work in progress and will be carried out in several steps:
1. Note primary dos/do nots as given by platform authorities (Apple, Google, etc)
2. Condense primary list into a universal set of mandatory guidelines
3. Create secondary criteria list driven by contributor conversation (e.g. logo themes)

### Wireframe

Wireframes should follow the design and appearance guidelines as set by the authority that manages the device in question. This ensures a 'native' feel to the app. Workflows should be as user friendly and avoid complexity to allow new users to quickly pick up how they can do what they need to do without thinking.
