## Overview
This is a doc to harden the UI of the BudgetFirst project while the architecture and frameworks are hardened and chosen. To engage with other aspects of the BudgetFirst project, please check [/r/budgetfirst](https://www.reddit.com/r/budgetfirst/) for community forums, the [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/budget-first) to request to join the contributor discussions on [Slack](https://budgetfirst.slack.com) and project management on [Taiga](https://tree.taiga.io/project/urbanhusky-budget-first/), or the eventual code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/BudgetFirst/BudgetFirst)!


## Assets Documentation Hardening Process

The following is a work in progress and will be carried out in several steps:
1. Note primary dos/do nots as given by platform authorities (Apple, Google, etc)
2. Condense primary list into a universal set of mandatory guidelines
3. Create secondary criteria list driven by contributor conversation (e.g. logo themes)

### Assets

Assets (e.g. fonts) in general should follow the guidelines as set by the authority that manages the device in question. This ensures a 'native' feel to the app.
